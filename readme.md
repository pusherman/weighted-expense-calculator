Weighted Group Expense Calculator
===========================

Simple command line PHP script to calulate the who owes what in a party with the ability to weight
groups (couples) more heavily than singles.

Useful when traveling with a group of couples and singles and expenses are split between everyone
equally but payments are dispursed through a single party representing multiple other people.

The couple buys the first meal for for $300.75.

The friend pays for sailing for the group at $200.00.

The couple pays for transportation for 50.28.


If each person is counted as an indvidual but paid as a married couple the program would show
the friend owes the married couple $116.57.
